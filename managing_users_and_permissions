# MANAGING USERS AND PERMISSIONS
# for example, we may have a marketing specialist named cee, or an IT administrator named Baiyenah,
# Who both need to access the server according to their roles.

# creating our new employees user account with useradd command
 sudo useradd -m -d /home/cee -s /bin/bash cee
 
# creating IT admin user account Baiyenah with adduser in Ubuntu.
# adduser command will prompt you user fullname, password, create the user home,
# and copy files from /etc/skel
 sudo adduser baiyenah

# we can use passwd command to create password for cee and baiyenah.
 sudo passwd cee

# Removing users
# Removing or disabling an account is very important when a user no longer needs to access a system.
# we first backup the files

 sudo mv /home/cee /var/store/file_archive

# we remove a users' home directory at the same time that you remove an account.

sudo userdel -r cee


# See list of users and detailed information about them.

 cat /etc/passwd

# To list or see users encrypted password stored. the shadow file is own by user root.

 sudo cat /etc/shadow

# Information regarding the groups that have been created on your system.

 cat /etc/group

 groups <username>

# Creating new groups. eg. creating a sales group for sales department.

 sudo groupadd sales                # redhat

 sudo addgroup sales               # debian

# To delete a group for redhat and debian

 sudo groupdel sales

 sudo delgroup sales

# To add sales specialist baiyenah to sales group.

 sudo usermod -aG sales baiyenah
# this command below will produce similar results. to add multiple users add -M.
 sudo gpasswd -a sales baiyenah

# Lets say baiyenah moves to IT department we could change her primary group to admins.

 sudo usermod -g admins baiyenah

# If you wish to remove a user from a group, you can use gpasswd command or deluser command.

 sudo gpasswd -d baiyenah admins

 sudo deluser baiyenah admins 

# shows when the password was last changed or password status.

 sudo passwd -S <username>

 sudo passwd -S cee


# MANAGING PASSWORDS AND PASSWORD POLICIES.


# How many days are required to pass  before the user will be able to change their password again.

# Setting a minimum number of days to force a waiting period in between password changes
# Making it less convenient for your users to change back to old password.

# The maximum number of days that can pass between password changes.

# the number of days that will pass before the expiration date on which user are warned of password change.

# We set how many days can pass after the password expires, in which case the account will be disabled.
