# MANAGING USERS AND PERMISSIONS
# for example, we may have a marketing specialist named cee, or an IT administrator named Baiyenah,
# Who both need to access the server according to their roles.

# creating our new employees user account with useradd command
 sudo useradd -m -d /home/cee -s /bin/bash cee
 
# creating IT admin user account Baiyenah with adduser in Ubuntu.
# adduser command will prompt you user fullname, password, create the user home,
# and copy files from /etc/skel
 sudo adduser baiyenah

# we can use passwd command to create password for cee and baiyenah.
 sudo passwd cee

# Removing users
# Removing or disabling an account is very important when a user no longer needs to access a system.
# we first backup the files

 sudo mv /home/cee /var/store/file_archive

# we remove a users' home directory at the same time that you remove an account.

sudo userdel -r cee
