# CONTROLLING FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS

# Linux has methods for securing file and directory access.
# This allows the system administrator or file owner to protect their files from unauthorized users.


# Granting Ownership to an Individual User

sudo chown bobby /tmp/bobsfile

# Granting Ownership to a Group

sudo chgrp security IDStool

# Checking Permissions

ls -la /home/bobby

# CHANGING PERMISSIONS

# Changing Permissions with Decimal Notation

sudo chmod 740 bobsfile

sudo chmod 774 /etc/wireshark


# Changing Permissions with UGO

sudo chmod ugo=rwx /tmp/bobsfile

sudo chmod go-wx /tmp/bobsfile

sudo chmod g+w /tmp/bobsfile

sudochmod u+wx, g-x, o-wx /tmp/bobsfile


# Setting More Secure Default Permissions with Masks

# Linux automatically assigns base permissions-- usually 666 for files and 777 for directories.
# we can change the default permissions with umask method

umask

# The umask default to 022. edit the /home/<username>.profile and add umask 007
umask 007


# SPECIAL PERMISSIONS
# Linux has special permissions that are more complicated.
# set user ID (SUID), set group ID (SGID).


# Granting Temporary Root Permissions with SUID
# To set the SUID bit, enter a 4 before the regular permissions

sudo chmod 4764 /tmp/bobfile

sudo chmod ug+srw filename

sudo chmod ug-s filename

# Granting the Root User's Group Permissions SGID
# to set the SGID bit, enter a 2 before the regular permissions
sudo chmod 2644 filename


# Special Permissions, Privilege Escalation, and the Hacker.
# Hackers can take advantage of special permissions to exploit linux systems through privilege escalation,
# whereby a regular user gains root or sysadmin privileges

find / -user root -perm -4000
cd /usr/bin 
# look for permissions with s bit which represent suid is set


# CONFIGURING FILE ATTRIBUTES AND ACCESS CONTROL LISTS
# Linux offers advanced features to provide more security for files and directories.

# File Attributes
# File attributes allow an operator to provide additional capabilities to files

sudo chattr +i contacts.odt

sudo chattr +a contacts.odt

lsattr contacts.odt

# to remove file attributes

sudo chattr -i contacts.odt


# File Access Control Lists
# Users can extend their file security setings with ACLs

# To view the current ACLs settings, use the getfacl command.

getfacl contacts.odt

# To modify privileges on files or directories

sudo setfacl -m u:omar:r contacts.odt
