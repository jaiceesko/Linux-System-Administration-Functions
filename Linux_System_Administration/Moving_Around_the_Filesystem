### MOVING AROUND THE FILE FILESYSTEM

# Navigating a filesystem

cd /home/joe

# Listing directories, subdirectories and their content

ls -la /home/joe

cat myfile.txt


## Using Basic Filesystem Commands

# Changes to another directory

cd /etc/passwd

# Current working directory

pwd

# Create a directory

mkdir memo

cd memo

touch memo.txt

# Changes the permission on a file or directory

sudo chmod -R 755 $HOME/campaign

sudo chmod go-rwx memo.txt

# List the content of a directory

ls -la /home/joe/memo

# Check the permissions of a directory

ls -ld /home/joe/memo

## Using file-redirection

echo "Hello World" > memo.txt

cp /home/campaign/campaign1.txt ~/marketing/urgentmeeting.txt

mv urgentmeeting.txt memo.txt

echo "I finished the project on $(date)" >> memo.txt

cat /etc/shadow 2> /dev/null

echo "Docker tutorial" &> docker.txt

man passwd | head -n 20


## Setting default file permission with umask

umask

# temporary umask

umask 027; touch applunch.txt

umask 007; mkdir myapp

umask 0002; touch apple.txt

# To change umask permanent add to .bashrc file in your home directory.

## Changing file ownership

# Change from ownership joe to zaira

sudo chown zaira /home/joe/memo/memo.txt

# To change both user and group owner

sudo chown zaira:sales /home/joe/memo/memo.txt
