ps -eo pid,user,group,gid,vsz,pcpu,pmem,comm --sort=-pcpu | head


## Monitoring processes with top and htop

top

sudo apt install htop

htop

## Managing Background and Foreground Processes


# Starting background processes

htop &

find /usr > tmp/alluserfiles &

vi /home/joe/campaign2024 &

# Check commands running in the background 

jobs

# to display process ID for the background job

jobs -l

# to foreground a  background job

fg %<job_id>

fg %3


## Killing and Renicing Processes

# Killing processes with kill command to signal processes by pid

pgrep htop

# to kill process clean with default signal 15

sudo kill 3002

# to kill a process by force with signal 9

sudo kill -9 3005

# killall command to signal processes by name

sudo killall -9 htop

sudo killall testme


## Setting Processor priority with nice and renice
# every process running on your system has a nice value between -20 and 19.

# to display the nice value

top

htop

# you can set the nice value for a particular command

sudo nice -n +5 updatedb &

# you can change the nice value with renice command as a root or admin privilege

# renice -n -5 20231
